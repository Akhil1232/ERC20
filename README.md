DEVECC20 Token

DEVECC20 is a custom ERC-20 token built with Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. This project showcases expertise in smart contract development, staking mechanisms, and CI/CD automation using Hardhat and GitLab pipelines.

The token includes minting, burning, pausing/unpausing, and a staking contract where users earn a 10% reward on their staked tokens.
